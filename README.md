**Catalog description:** Concepts and practices for analysis of English by computer with emphasis on the applications of computational analysis to problems in applied linguistics such as corpus analysis and recognition of learner language in computer-assisted learning and language assessment.

**Note about computer programming:** This is not a programming class. A working knowledge of a programming language is expected from students who are taking this class.

## Major topics:

**Topic 1. Word and sentence tokenization: The first step in most computational analysis tasks (Weeks 1-2)**

Learning outcome:

- define the task of computational analysis (research orthographic signals of sentence boundaries)
- develop a set of regular expressions for a rule-based sentence tokenzier for English

Assessment: participation points (10% of grade)

**Topic 2. Evaluation of computational approaches to language analysis (Weeks 3-4)**

Learning outcomes:

- manually annotate a gold-standard corpus for system evaluation
- calculate, interpret, and report inter-annotator reliability using Krippendorff's alpha
- calculate, interpret, and report standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) of the system

Assessment: a two-page write-up about the implementation and evaluation of the tokenizer (Methods and Results sections) (30% of grade)

**Topic 3. Computational analysis of English spelling: editing distance (Weeks 5-6)**

Learning outcomes:

- explain and use the method of dynamic programming for combinatory optimization
- implement the calculation of Levenshtein distance between two strings

Assessment: an in-class quiz to demonstrate the understanding of dymanic programming (10% of grade)

**Topic 4. Computational analysis of English morphology: implementations and applications of stemming and POS tagging (Weeks 7-10)**

Learning outcomes:

- implement a rule-based Porter stemmer using regular expressions
- explain and use the Viterbi algorithm for POS tagging

Assessment: participation points (20% of grade)

**Topic 5. Computational analysis of English syntax: post-processing syntactic-parse information (Weeks 11-15)**

Learning outcomes:

- computationally process syntactic-parse information
- develop and implement a personal project using an off-the-shelf parser or a manually-annotated treebank

Possible directions for the personal project include:
 - a corpus-based empirical research study
 - development of an automated writing evaluation tool/grammar checker
 - a natural-language understanding module for a (spoken) dialog system

Assessment: a short paper documenting the final project (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) (30% of grade)
