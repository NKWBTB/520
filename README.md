**Catalog description:** Concepts and practices for analysis of English by computer with emphasis on the applications of computational analysis to problems in applied linguistics such as corpus analysis and recognition of learner language in computer-assisted learning and language assessment.

**Note about computer programming:** This is not a programming class. A working knowledge of a programming language is expected from students who are taking this class.

## Major topics:

- Topic 1. Word and sentence tokenization: The first step in most computational analysis tasks (Weeks 1-2)

Hands-on activity: develop a set of regular expressions for a rule-based sentence tokenzier for English

- Topic 2. Evaluation of computational approaches to language analysis (Weeks 3-4)

Hands-on activity: manually annotate a gold-standard corpus with sentence boundaries; check inter-annotator reliability; 
calculate, interpret, and report standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) of the rule-based tokenizer developed in the previous activity

- Topic 3. Computational analysis of English spelling: editing distance (Weeks 5-6)

Hands-on activity: apply dynamic programming to the calculation of Levenshtein distance

- Topic 4. Computational analysis of English morphology: implementations and applications of stemming and POS tagging (Weeks 7-10)

Hands-on activity: implement a rules-based Porter stemmer and a statistical (Viterbi) POS tagger for English

- Topic 5. Computational analysis of English syntax: post-processing syntactic-parse information (Weeks 11-15)

Hands-on activity: a personal project using an off-the-shelf parser or a manually-annotated treebank

Possible directions for the personal project include:
 - a corpus-based empirical research study
 - development of an automated writing evaluation tool/grammar checker
 - a natural-language understanding module for a (spoken) dialog system
